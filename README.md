INTRODUCTION
The depletion of fossil fuel energy resources, increasing concern of air pollution, global warming and energy crisis have encouraged the research for clean and pollution-free sources of energy. Wind energy is one of the most common of clean energies that has been developed significantly in the world. This type of energy is more accessible, inexhaustible, fairly cheaper, renewable and sustainable, and environmentally friendly. Wind energy is a free source of energy that has served the mankind for many countries for driving wind turbines, pumping water, ships, etc. Developing wind energy systems can improve the idea of electricity generation without pollution in the future.  
The variable and unpredictable nature of wind poses a challenge for optimizing the performance of wind turbines and ensuring a stable power supply. As the proportion of wind power in the power network continues to increase, it will bring a challenge to the safety and stabilization of the power network and then restrict the scale of wind power development. Accurate wind power forecasting is one of the crucial technologies to deal with this problem.
At present there are physical methods, statistical methods, learning methods and combinations of these three methods for wind power prediction. Different methods are used for different time scales and different data sources. Any of these three methods can be used based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) data for the prediction within forty-eight hours. 
Machine learning is a field of computer science domain that tries to provide learning capability to computers or other devices without being explicitly operated. It aims to develop methods and algorithms to learn from data and forecast based on data. Machine learning algorithms are successfully utilized to describe the behaviour of the dataset, model input features with respect to the expected output and forecast output features with respect to its historical records.  
A precise forecast needs to overcome problems of variable energy production caused by fluctuating weather conditions. Power generated by wind is highly dependent on the wind speed. Though it is highly non- linear, wind speed follows a certain pattern over a certain period of time. Accurate and reliable wind speed forecasts are a significant challenge due to its stochastic nature with high rates of change, highly nonlinear behaviour with no typical patterns, and dependency on elevation, terrain, atmospheric pressure, and temperature, which results in large uncertainties of wind speeds. This makes it difficult for any machine learning model to figure out a pattern and give an accurate prediction. There are several Machine Learning models like Long short-term Memory, Random Forest (RF), Support vector machine (SVM) [4], Logistic chaos search optimization (LCASO) [2], RNN, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) [2], Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) [2], Multi-Layer Feed Forward Neural network (MLFFNN) [4], etc. Selection of the suitable machine learning model is the most important and challenging thing. By considering the advantages and disadvantages LSTM and RNN machine learning model is selected for the wind power prediction.
Long Short-Term Memory and Convolution Neural Networks, which are popular types of neural network architectures that have proven effective in time series forecasting, making them suitable for wind power prediction. Both LSTM and CNN are designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for modelling the time-varying nature of wind speed and other relevant factors in the context of wind power prediction. CNN is a type of neural network architecture designed for classifying data. They have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to maintain a memory of previous inputs in their internal state. LSTM is a specialized type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. It introduces memory cells with gating mechanisms that selectively control the flow of information, allowing them to capture long-term dependencies more effectively. 
LSTM-RNNâ€™s are specialized neural network architectures designed for sequential data, making them particularly suitable for time series forecasting applications such as wind power prediction [6]. LSTMs address this limitation by incorporating memory cells equipped with gating mechanisms that regulate the flow of information. These memory cells enable LSTMs to selectively store and retrieve information over extended sequences, making them adept at capturing and learning from long-term dependencies. The enhanced memory and gating mechanisms make LSTMs well-suited for applications where understanding and utilizing context over extended time intervals is crucial. Both LSTM and CNN architectures are employed in wind power prediction to model the complex relationships between wind speed, direction, and power production over time, contributing to improved accuracy in forecasting renewable energy output.
The prediction problem was divided into two categories. Estimation for given weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, pressure etc. determining the energy power prediction. Prediction part is to predicting the power generated by the system without any knowledge of the future weather. This is important because predicting the future weather is also a different prediction problem machine learning with its different set of challenges. Estimation is about predicting wind power generation given the current wind direction. Current wind and temperature conditions are given.
PROBLEME DESCRIPTION
Wind power is a renewable and clean source of energy that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. wind power generation is highly variable and intermittent, depending on the weather conditions and wind speed. Therefore, it is important to forecast the wind power output accurately and efficiently to optimize the operation and planning of wind farms. Wind energy is a vital renewable energy source, but its production is inherently variable due to the fluctuating nature of wind. Accurately predicting wind power generation is crucial for several reasons. Grid balancing, it enables utilities to integrate wind power effectively into the electricity grid, maintaining stability and avoiding disruptions. Energy trading, helps energy companies make informed decisions about buying and selling electricity based on anticipated wind power production. Planning and scheduling, allows wind farm operators to optimize maintenance schedules and energy production strategies.
ML techniques can be applied to wind power forecasting by using historical data, weather data and wind turbine data. The problems that arise during power prediction are Nonlinearity and variability of wind, Temporal Dynamics, data pre-processing challenges. Therefore, it is important to choose the appropriate Machine Learning technique to solve these problems. Certainly, the prediction of wind power using machine learning is a crucial task in the renewable energy sector. Accurately estimate the amount of wind energy production per hour in the next 24 hours is one of the major challenges. Some of the other challenges are Randomness, Wind power generation is inherently random due to changing wind patterns. Intermittency, Wind energy production varies over time due to climate, seasons, and other factors. 
The goal of machine learning in wind power prediction is to develop a model that can learn from historical data (wind speed, power output, meteorological data) and use that knowledge to accurately forecast future wind power generation. This typically involves, Data acquisition, Collecting historical wind farm data along with relevant meteorological information. Data pre-processing, it means cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning algorithms, which may involve handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering. 
Model selection and training, is choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) and training them on the prepared data. Model evaluation, assessing the accuracy and generalizability of the trained model using various metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean squared error). Prediction and deployment, utilizing the trained model to forecast future wind power generation and integrating it into grid management or energy trading systems. By using machine learning, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of wind power prediction, leading to a more reliable and sustainable energy future.
