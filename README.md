INTRODUCTION
The depletion of fossil fuel energy resources, increasing concern of air pollution, global warming and energy crisis have encouraged the research for clean and pollution-free sources of energy. Wind energy is one of the most common of clean energies that has been developed significantly in the world. This type of energy is more accessible, inexhaustible, fairly cheaper, renewable and sustainable, and environmentally friendly. Wind energy is a free source of energy that has served the mankind for many countries for driving wind turbines, pumping water, ships, etc. Developing wind energy systems can improve the idea of electricity generation without pollution in the future. Renewable energy sources are getting more attention from the energy production authorities, countries, and energy companies because of their natural, free of costs, and environmentally clean nature. 
The variable and unpredictable nature of wind poses a challenge for optimizing the performance of wind turbines and ensuring a stable power supply [1]. As the proportion of wind power in the power network continues to increase, it will bring a challenge to the safety and stabilization of the power network and then restrict the scale of wind power development. The accurate prediction of the wind power can effectively reduce or avoid the adverse effect of wind farm on power network [8]. And it is very important for the sustainable development of the wind power. Reliable short-term wind speed forecasts play a practical and crucial role in wind energy conversion systems, such as the dynamic control of wind turbines and power system scheduling. With the increasing scale of wind power integration, the randomness, volatility and intermittence of wind power have brought great challenges to the security, stability and economy of power system. Accurate wind power forecasting is one of the crucial technologies to deal with this problem.
At present there are physical methods, statistical methods, learning methods and combinations of these three methods for wind power prediction. Different methods are used for different time scales and different data sources. Statistical methods and learning methods are used based on history data for short-term prediction of wind power within six hours. Any of these three methods can be used based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) data for the prediction within forty-eight hours [6]. Physical methods aim to describe the physical process of converting wind to power and models all of the steps involved. Statistical methods aim at describing the connection between predicted wind and power output directly by statistical analysis of time series from data in the past. Common statistical methods are time series method, regression analysis method and Kalman filter method [3] etc. Learning methods use artificial intelligence algorithms that are able to implicitly describe nonlinear and highly complex relations between input data and output data. The wind speed and power were forecasted by neural network based on time series, but the effect was relatively poor for long time scales.
Machine learning is a field of computer science domain that tries to provide learning capability to computers or other devices without being explicitly operated. It aims to develop methods and algorithms to learn from data and forecast based on data. Machine learning algorithms are successfully utilized to describe the behaviour of the dataset, model input features with respect to the expected output and forecast output features with respect to its historical records. Machine learning algorithms are one of the alternatives to forecasting wind power based on wind speed data. Deep learning is the development of artificial neural network. Deep learning conforms to the trend of big data and has the strong learning and generalization ability for massive data [6]. 
A precise forecast needs to overcome problems of variable energy production caused by fluctuating weather conditions. Power generated by wind is highly dependent on the wind speed. Though it is highly non- linear, wind speed follows a certain pattern over a certain period of time. Accurate and reliable wind speed forecasts are a significant challenge due to its stochastic nature with high rates of change, highly nonlinear behaviour with no typical patterns, and dependency on elevation, terrain, atmospheric pressure, and temperature, which results in large uncertainties of wind speeds. This makes it difficult for any machine learning model to figure out a pattern and give an accurate prediction. There are several Machine Learning models like Long short-term Memory, Random Forest (RF), Support vector machine (SVM) [4], Logistic chaos search optimization (LCASO) [2], RNN, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) [2], Back-propagation neural network (BPNN) [2], Multi-Layer Feed Forward Neural network (MLFFNN) [4], etc. Selection of the suitable machine learning model is the most important and challenging thing. By considering the advantages and disadvantages LSTM and RNN machine learning model is selected for the wind power prediction.
Long Short-Term Memory and Convolution Neural Networks, which are popular types of neural network architectures that have proven effective in time series forecasting, making them suitable for wind power prediction. Both LSTM and CNN are designed to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for modelling the time-varying nature of wind speed and other relevant factors in the context of wind power prediction. CNN is a type of neural network architecture designed for classifying data. They have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to maintain a memory of previous inputs in their internal state. LSTM is a specialized type of RNN designed to address the vanishing gradient problem. It introduces memory cells with gating mechanisms that selectively control the flow of information, allowing them to capture long-term dependencies more effectively. 
LSTM-RNN’s are specialized neural network architectures designed for sequential data, making them particularly suitable for time series forecasting applications such as wind power prediction [6]. LSTMs address this limitation by incorporating memory cells equipped with gating mechanisms that regulate the flow of information. These memory cells enable LSTMs to selectively store and retrieve information over extended sequences, making them adept at capturing and learning from long-term dependencies. The enhanced memory and gating mechanisms make LSTMs well-suited for applications where understanding and utilizing context over extended time intervals is crucial. Both LSTM and CNN architectures are employed in wind power prediction to model the complex relationships between wind speed, direction, and power production over time, contributing to improved accuracy in forecasting renewable energy output.
The prediction problem was divided into two categories. Estimation for given weather conditions like temperature, wind speed, pressure etc. determining the energy power prediction. Prediction part is to predicting the power generated by the system without any knowledge of the future weather. This is important because predicting the future weather is also a different prediction problem machine learning with its different set of challenges. Estimation is about predicting wind power generation given the current wind direction. Current wind and temperature conditions are given. 
Estimations models are useful if it gets the weather information about the present day or the future publicly using machine learning with certain accuracy. Then this model can be used to be the perfect estimation of power generated by the system. Prediction part is to predicting the power generated by the system without any knowledge of the future weather. This is important because predicting the future weather is also a different prediction problem machine learning with its different set of challenges. It is not going to have any knowledge what wind speed is going to be or what temperature or pressure is going to be in the future. So, it tries to predict the power only by analysing pattern in the past data using LSTM. LSTM will analyse the prior data and try to get useful knowledge about the patterns in previous data. And using that knowledge it is going to predict the results. root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) methods of validation are used for predicting future values and evaluating results [8].

Problem Description
Wind power is a renewable and clean source of energy that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. wind power generation is highly variable and intermittent, depending on the weather conditions and wind speed. Therefore, it is important to forecast the wind power output accurately and efficiently to optimize the operation and planning of wind farms. Wind energy is a vital renewable energy source, but its production is inherently variable due to the fluctuating nature of wind. Accurately predicting wind power generation is crucial for several reasons. Grid balancing, it enables utilities to integrate wind power effectively into the electricity grid, maintaining stability and avoiding disruptions. Energy trading, helps energy companies make informed decisions about buying and selling electricity based on anticipated wind power production. Planning and scheduling, allows wind farm operators to optimize maintenance schedules and energy production strategies.
ML techniques can be applied to wind power forecasting by using historical data, weather data and wind turbine data. The problems that arise during power prediction are Nonlinearity and variability of wind, Temporal Dynamics, data pre-processing challenges. Therefore, it is important to choose the appropriate Machine Learning technique to solve these problems. Certainly, the prediction of wind power using machine learning is a crucial task in the renewable energy sector. Accurately estimate the amount of wind energy production per hour in the next 24 hours is one of the major challenges. Some of the other challenges are Randomness, Wind power generation is inherently random due to changing wind patterns. Intermittency, Wind energy production varies over time due to climate, seasons, and other factors. 
The goal of machine learning in wind power prediction is to develop a model that can learn from historical data (wind speed, power output, meteorological data) and use that knowledge to accurately forecast future wind power generation. This typically involves, Data acquisition, Collecting historical wind farm data along with relevant meteorological information. Data pre-processing, it means cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning algorithms, which may involve handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering. 
Model selection and training, is choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks) and training them on the prepared data. Model evaluation, assessing the accuracy and generalizability of the trained model using various metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean squared error). Prediction and deployment, utilizing the trained model to forecast future wind power generation and integrating it into grid management or energy trading systems. By using machine learning, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of wind power prediction, leading to a more reliable and sustainable energy future.
